        About Rare Souls Films
      </h1>

      <p>
        Rare Souls Films is a women-led,
        neurodivergent-powered production company
        that tells stories for the misfits, the
        feelers, the beautifully strange. Our
        films don&apos;t follow the rules ‚Äî they
        follow the raw, the real, and the gut
        punch of human experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe the weird is beautiful. The
        outsider is the hero. And cinema should
        rattle your spirit, not lull you to sleep.
        We&apos;re here for the bruised hearts,
        the offbeat dreamers, and the rare minds
        that see the world sideways.
      </p>

        üë©‚Äçüé¨ Meet the Founder
      </h2>

      <p>
        Rare Souls Films was founded by Janilee
        Jones ‚Äî a painfully creative, unreasonably
        stubborn Swedish-born filmmaker and actor.
        She earned her film degree from Santa
        Monica College in Los Angeles back in
        2016, then later trained as an actor at
        ArtsEd in London, completing her
        master&apos;s in acting in 2024.
      </p>

      <p>
        Janilee is neurodivergent. She&apos;s
        lived everywhere from Sweden to Uruguay to
        the U.S. to the U.K., picking up stories
        like souvenirs and turning existential
        crises into scripts. She believes in
        magic, melancholy, messiness, and making
        things that actually matter.
